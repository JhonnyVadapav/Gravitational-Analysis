# Gravitational-Analysis-
This is a pretty simple code which can be used for simulation of the solar system , and calculate various quantities like karman line , orbital velocity , gravitational potential etc., by entering simple values like mass,radius,density of a planet etc. The code also stores all the data in the databases in your local devices.
